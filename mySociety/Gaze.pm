package mySociety::Gaze;

use RABX;
use mySociety::Config;

=item configure [URL]

Set the RABX URL which will be used to call the functions. If you don't
specify the URL, mySociety configuration variable GAZE_URL will be used
instead.

=cut
my $rabx_client = undef;
sub configure (;$) {
    my ($url) = @_;
    $url = mySociety::Config::get('GAZE_URL') if !defined($url);
    $rabx_client = new RABX::Client($url) or die qq(Bad RABX proxy URL "$url");
}

=item Gaze::find_places COUNTRY STATE QUERY [MAXRESULTS [MINSCORE]]

  Search for places in COUNTRY (ISO code) which match the given search
  QUERY. The country must be from the list returned by
  get_Gaze::find_places_countries. STATE, if specified, is a customary code for a
  top-level administrative subregion within the given COUNTRY; at present,
  this is only useful for the United States, and should be passed as undef
  otherwise. 

  Returns a reference to a list of [NAME, IN, NEAR, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE,
  STATE, SCORE]. When IN is defined, it gives the name of a region in which
  the place lies; when NEAR is defined, it gives a short list of other
  places near to the returned place. These allow nonunique names to be
  disambiguated by the user. LATITUDE and LONGITUDE are in decimal degrees,
  north- and east-positive, in WGS84. Earlier entries in the returned list
  are better matches to the query. 

  At most MAXRESULTS (default, 20) results, and only results with score at
  least MINSCORE (default 0, percentage from 0 to 100) are returned. The
  MAXRESULTS limit is ignored when the top results all have the same
  relevancy. They are all returned. So for example, this means that if you
  search for Cambridge in the US with MAXRESULTS of 5, it will return all
  the Cambridges, even though there are more than 5 of them.

  On error, throws an exception.

=item Gaze::get_country_from_ip ADDRESS

  Return the country code for the given IP address, or undef if none could
  be found.

=item Gaze::get_population_density LAT LON

  Return an estimate of the population density at (LAT, LON) in persons per
  square kilometer.

=item Gaze::get_radius_containing_population LAT LON NUMBER [MAXIMUM]

  Return an estimate of the radius (in km) of the smallest circle around
  (LAT, LON) which contains at least NUMBER people. If MAXIMUM is defined,
  return that value rather than any larger computed radius; if not
  specified, use 150km.

=cut
