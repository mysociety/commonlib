# Run an external command, capturing its stdout and stderr
# streams into variables.
#
# So it’s rather like the `backtick` built-in, except that:
#   - The command is run as-is, rather than being parsed by the shell;
#   - Standard error is also captured.
#
# After the run() method has been called, the instance variables
# out, err, status and exited contain the contents of the process’s
# stdout, the contents of its stderr, and the exit status.  exited
# is true if the process exited normally, and false otherwise
# (usually indicating a crash or timeout).
#
# Example usage:
#   require 'external_command'
#   xc = ExternalCommand("ls", "-l").run()
#   puts "Ran ls -l with exit status #{xc.status}"
#   puts "===STDOUT===\n#{xc.out}"
#   puts "===STDERR===\n#{xc.err}"
#
# The out and err attributes are writeable. If you assign
# a string, after calling the constructor and before calling
# run(), then the subprocess output/error will be appended
# to this string.

# <rant author="robin">
#   In any sane language, this would be implemented with a
#   single child process. The parent process would block on
#   select(), and when the child process terminated, the
#   select call would be interrupted by a CHLD signal
#   and return EINTR. Unfortunately Ruby goes out of its
#   way to prevent this from working, automatically restarting
#   the select call if EINTR is returned. Therefore we
#   use a parent-child-grandchild arrangement, where the
#   parent blocks on select() and the child blocks on
#   waitpid(). When the child detects that the grandchild
#   has finished, it writes to a pipe that’s included in
#   the parent’s select() for this purpose.
