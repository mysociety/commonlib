# Run an external command, capturing its stdout and stderr streams into
# variables, and returning some information about the way the process
# exited.

#
# After the run() method has been called, the instance variables
# out, err, and status contain the contents of the process<E2><80><99>s
# stdout, the contents of its stderr, and the exit status.  The instance
# variable exited is true if the process exited normally, and false
# otherwise (usually indicating a crash or timeout). The instance
# variable timed_out indicates that this code forced the process to
# finish.
#
# Example usage:
#   require 'external_command'
#   xc = ExternalCommand("ls", "-l").run()
#   puts "Ran ls -l with exit status #{xc.status}"
#   puts "===STDOUT===\n#{xc.out}"
#   puts "===STDERR===\n#{xc.err}"
#
# The out and err attributes are writeable. If you assign
# a string, after calling the constructor and before calling
# run(), then the subprocess output/error will be appended
# to this string.
